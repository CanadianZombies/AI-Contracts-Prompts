Here is my project.

Before changing anything:
1. Enumerate all existing capabilities.
2. Identify all locked interfaces and schemas.
3. Wait for my approval.

Constraints:
- No existing capability may be removed or altered.
- JSON inputs must remain backward compatible.
- Unknown fields must be preserved.
- Changes must be additive only.

Goal:
- This system currently uses email to create wordpress posts. Replace emailing with wordpress REST api to post content, Create and Update hub pages, update evergreen content.
- Ensure wordpress rest-api (OAuth) login information loads from JSON file.
- Add a cache to store pages and posts created, and safety check if page/post already exists, change from creating page to updating in the event it already exists.
- Ensure full rest implementation without losing the original intended capabilities (minus the change from email to rest).

After implementation:
Provide a capability diff and confirm no regressions.
